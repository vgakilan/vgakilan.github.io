# 👋 Hello, I’m Akilan.

Someone curious — who sees, learns, changes, and adopts.

A seasoned QA professional deeply rooted in the insurance domain, now exploring AI and blending, shaping, and redefining. 

Beyond work, I’m drawn to travel, stoicism, photography, science, and climbing.

I believe in trusting the process — like Steve Jobs said:

***“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.  
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.”***

This site is my digital lab and journal — a place for thoughts, experiments, and real reflections.

Welcome to the journey. :-).
